# Hourly NVIDIA NIM OpenCode Development — Evidence Doctoring

## Claim boundary

This workflow can propose one bounded pull request. It does not claim autonomous
semantic correctness, production safety, customer acceptance, scientific
validity, or permission to merge, release, deploy, or approve. Deterministic
tests, schemas, security scanners, CodeRabbit/OpenCode review, human judgment,
and exact-head branch rules remain independent controls.

## Source-supported facts and project decisions

| Topic | Source-supported fact | Four Pillars decision |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub jobs | Jobs run on separate runner instances and receive scoped tokens | Model, verifier, and publisher are separate jobs |
| GitHub App authentication | A workflow can mint an installation token with explicit repository permissions | Publication token is minted only after non-executing validation |
| Artifact handoff | Artifact upload/download actions expose immutable IDs and digests | Patch ID, digest, base, size, count, and modes are checked twice |
| OpenCode | OpenCode is a programmable coding agent with provider configuration | One checksum-pinned binary uses the vendored contextual-orchestrator gateway only |
| Contextual Orchestrator | `ContextualWisdomLab/contextual-orchestrator`'s `orchestrator/free` pool routes across every live-discovered free-priced provider and fails closed when none is available | A pinned-commit vendored gateway sidecar, not a direct NVIDIA NIM call, is the model's only provider; only its ephemeral loopback bearer reaches the proposal process |
| SSDF | NIST SP 800-218 recommends protected build environments, review, provenance, and vulnerability response | Fresh verification and ordinary PR governance remain mandatory |
| AI risk | ISO/IEC 23894:2023 and 42001:2023 require contextual risk treatment and controlled change | Stable no-op reasons, bounded proposals, traceable decisions, and rollback are documented |
| Test-time compute | Fugu, Conductor, and TRINITY distinguish routing from deeper role-based workflows | Runtime LLM increments must preserve route/conduct and access-list controls |

The GitHub, OpenCode, NVIDIA, NIST, ISO, and paper references below follow APA 7
conventions as closely as the source type permits.

## Upstream version evidence

The official OpenCode GitHub release API identified OpenCode 1.18.13 as the
current upstream release on 2026-08-06. The workflow deliberately pins OpenCode 1.17.13 because its Linux x64 archive SHA-256
`157afa289d1a8d9372de0ce19ac726119b937a1f6b201808d46f06e4e59bb348`
had already been independently reviewed in the CWL Noema workflow. The newer
archive is not adopted until its exact asset digest is independently captured,
reviewed, committed, and exercised. “Latest” is not allowed to mean
“unverified.”

This is a supply-chain project decision, not a claim that OpenCode 1.17.13 is
functionally superior. The scheduled agent cannot auto-update itself.

## Orchestration research application

**Fugu.** Fugu frames orchestration as selecting between direct model use and
deeper coordinated execution. Four Pillars already exposes explicit
`auto|route|conduct` organization modes; the autonomous prompt requires future
LLM changes to preserve this distinction.

**Conductor.** Conductor generates natural-language subtasks, worker assignment,
and access lists. The prompt therefore requires explicit workflow stages,
dependencies, least-privilege evidence access, and bounded recursive depth.

**TRINITY.** TRINITY emphasizes specialized thinker, worker, verifier, and
synthesis roles. The prompt requires role-specific reasoning effort and
reasoning-level ablation rather than one undifferentiated maximum-effort call.

These papers motivate evaluation hypotheses. They do not prove that deeper
orchestration always improves Four Pillars reports. Deterministic grounding,
latency-insensitive quality tests, provider-reported usage where available, and
human review must compare forced routing and conducted cells.

## Tooling limitations recorded

Consensus search was requested for this increment but did not return a usable
paper record. Context7 reported its monthly quota exhausted. Primary paper
records, official documentation, and the existing Contextual Orchestrator
doctoring were therefore used directly. This limitation does not weaken the
deterministic workflow tests and must be revisited in a later literature update.

## Residual risk

Proposed code is executed by an uncredentialed verifier with ordinary
hosted-runner egress, and artifact digests do not establish semantic safety.
The vendored contextual-orchestrator gateway sidecar (pinned commit
`045d17da5e2aea56a97e241ee158ab1628d78660`, the same commit
`ContextualWisdomLab/.github`'s central review sidecar trusts) now narrows the
model process's own credential to an ephemeral, loopback-only bearer instead
of a raw upstream provider key, resolving the broker gap this section
previously named as a future improvement; the gateway process itself still
holds the five org provider secrets in memory for the run's duration. A later
central reusable workflow can remove duplicated repository policy. No future
improvement may combine model execution with publication authority.
